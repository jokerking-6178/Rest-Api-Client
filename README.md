# Project Description 

Weather API Client - Java REST API Consumer
This Java application demonstrates a complete REST API client implementation that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap public API and displays it in a structured, user-friendly format.
Core Functionality
The application handles HTTP requests using Java's built-in HttpURLConnection class to communicate with the OpenWeatherMap REST API. It processes JSON responses using Google's Gson library, parsing complex weather data into a custom WeatherData model class. The program features comprehensive error handling for network issues, invalid city names, and API authentication problems.
Technical Implementation
The project follows object-oriented design principles with a structured approach to data modeling. The WeatherData class encapsulates weather information including temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and atmospheric conditions. The application implements proper HTTP request/response handling with status code validation and JSON parsing capabilities.
User Experience
The console-based interface provides an interactive experience where users can query weather information for any city worldwide. The output is formatted with Unicode characters and structured layouts, displaying location details, temperature data, weather conditions, and atmospheric measurements in an organized, readable format.
Key Features

HTTP Request Handling: Makes GET requests to external REST APIs
JSON Processing: Parses and extracts data from JSON responses
Error Management: Handles network errors, invalid inputs, and API failures
Data Modeling: Structures weather information in Java objects
Interactive Interface: Console-based user interaction with formatted output

Dependencies & Setup
The project uses Maven for dependency management, requiring only the Gson library for JSON processing. Setup involves obtaining an OpenWeatherMap API key and configuring the Maven environment. The application demonstrates practical REST API consumption patterns commonly used in enterprise Java applications, making it an excellent example of HTTP client implementation and JSON data processing.
